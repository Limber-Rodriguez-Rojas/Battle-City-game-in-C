I developed a version in C using the SDL graphic library.

## Demo

[Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQdxiQNExBM "Youtube Video")

This is meant to be an educational project to learn about the use of the SDL graphic library

>     Make sure you have already installed SDL 1.2 library on your PC to compile it!
