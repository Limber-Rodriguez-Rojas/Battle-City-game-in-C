# Battle City game in C
Battle City is a multi-directional shooter video game for the Family Computer produced and published in 1985 by Namco.

I developed a version in C using the SDL graphic library.

This is meant to be a didactic project to learn about the use of the SDL graphic library

>     Make sure you have already installed SDL 1.2 library on your PC to compile it!
